Hello! I'm Yiming Cao, a dedicated researcher with a rich background in architecture and a Master's degree in Engineering from Southeast University. My academic journey has been deeply influenced by a fascination with historical urban landscapes and the application of modern analytical techniques to understand and preserve them.

### Necessitatibus

Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to engage in diverse research projects that span from the digital reconstruction of the Ming Dynasty's Nanjing to analyzing the urban dynamics of Bhaktapur through GIS mapping. My work primarily focuses on blending historical insights with contemporary urban planning methodologies to offer new perspectives on sustainable development and heritage conservation.

### Fugit, laboriosam

As I continue to explore the intersections of data science and urban studies, I am eager to contribute to the field of urban spatial analysis, using big data to enhance our understanding of historical and modern urban environments. My goal is to advance my career in academia, developing research that supports thoughtful and informed urban planning and policy-making.

Thank you for visiting my website, where I share my research, projects, and insights into the ever-evolving dialogue between our past and the future of urban spaces.
