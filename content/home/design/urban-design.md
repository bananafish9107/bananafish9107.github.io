The Readtory renovation project represents a pivotal initiative in urban regeneration, focusing on the revitalization of a historic site into a vibrant cultural and community hub.

##### Field Research and Concept Development
My involvement began with extensive field research, where I engaged directly with the site's spatial dynamics and historical context. This phase was crucial for understanding the intrinsic values and challenges posed by the existing structures. Insights gained from this research fed directly into the concept design phase, where I contributed to developing a vision that balanced the preservation of historical integrity with the introduction of modern urban design elements.

##### Historical Building Assessment                        
A significant aspect of my role was assessing the historical buildings within the project area. This involved detailed analysis to determine the structural and aesthetic conditions of the buildings and evaluating their potential for integration into the new design. My assessments helped ensure that renovation plans respected the siteâ€™s heritage while aligning with contemporary safety and design standards.

Choosing the right partners was critical to the project's success. I took a leading role in selecting collaboration studios, evaluating potential partners based on their expertise in historical preservation and urban design innovation. This process was guided by a strategic vision to bring together diverse skills that complemented each other, ensuring a holistic approach to the renovation.

The Redtory renovation project is set to redefine the local urban landscape by transforming a historic site into a dynamic public space that caters to cultural, educational, and social activities. Future work will continue to build on this foundation, focusing on sustainable urban growth and community engagement, ensuring the Readtory site remains a beacon of cultural heritage and modern urban design.
