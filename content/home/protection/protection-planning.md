##### Historical Assessment:
A detailed review of the city wall's historical significance, supported by extensive field surveys and literature reviews, established the foundation for the preservation strategies.The project developed pivotal nodes and urban sections along the city wall that address commercial, cultural, social, and ecological considerations. These designs were informed by the dynamic history of the city's development and aimed to revitalize and integrate the wall into the modern urban landscape.Designs included transforming key areas such as the Northern section adjacent to railways into lively cultural hubs. Proposals utilized the potential relocation of rail facilities to enhance access and connectivity, turning the city wall into a vibrant public realm.


##### Cultural and Ecological Integration:
Tourism and Cultural Connectivity: Leveraging nearby historical and scenic sites, the project proposed a tourism route linking major landmarks with the city wall. This route aimed to enhance visitor experience and cultural appreciation, showcasing the wall not just as a boundary but as a central narrative thread in the city’s urban tapestry. Ecological and Recreational Spaces: Plans for green belts, leisure zones, and cultural venues along the wall encouraged community engagement and ecological sustainability, transforming the wall’s vicinity into a multifunctional urban corridor.
